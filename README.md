- Built an unsupervised anomaly detection system for Linux system logs using TF-IDF embeddings and Isolation Forest to automatically flag rare or suspicious events.
- Designed a custom log parser to extract timestamps, severity levels, and message patterns from syslog entries.
- Injected synthetic anomalies and achieved ~91% detection accuracy, demonstrating robustness across varied log types.
- Visualized anomaly scores and clustered log behavior using PCA and Matplotlib for interpretable security insights.

This description is perfectly sized, powerful, and safe in interviews.
